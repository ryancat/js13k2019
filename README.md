# Gem of love
A 2D game of a story about fighting dragons and bring **BACK** the gem of love

# Game overview
King George wants to pass his throne to one of his sons, Alex, Barry and Calvin. He send them to bring **BACK** the most valuable gem and claimed who find the gem shall be the new king. Play as one of the sons, you are on your journey to find the most valuable gem - the gem of love.

Along the road you will fight monsters, ghosts, and finally the dragon bosses. Each dragon protects one gem which you can get after defeating it -- but it may not be the gem of love. You will get messages from NPC and bosses (after defeating them) which will tell you where is the gem of love. Keep fighting and you will get stronger, and eventually find the strongest dragon in the world, and get the gem of love!

# Some more details
## The world
The whole world is a huge square shape map. You started at the center of that map. The further you are from the center, the harder it will become to fight the monsters. The Dragon bosses live randomly in the world, and are also getting stronger with distance from the center. 

## The character
You will be able to play as any character in the game. You are free to switch to another character any time when you are not in fight. Each character has HP for lifes and EP for energies. They will able to get HP or EP points randomly after fights.

Alex is expert of fire. He would fight with fireballs, which has high damage point. Barry is export of ice. He would fight with iceballs, which can slowdown enemy. Calvin is export of light. He would fight with lightballs which can cause chain damage among enemy close by. 

Each attack will consume energy points (EP). When heart points (HP) drop to zero, the character will be dead, and you are forced to teleport to another character. When all three characters dead, the game is over with sad ending.

## How to get stronger?
Each time you kill a dragon, you will get a gem, which will make you stronger.

## How to win?
You need to find and defeat the strongest dragon -- the dragon of Thanos, to bring back the gem of love. If all characters (all three princes) are alive, you will trigger happy ending.
